[A Trading Nation](https://www.example.com) aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:

* focussing resources
* making changes to strategy
* making changes to policy


## Focussing resources
Scotland will increase exports by focussing resources where they will have most impact.

For example, [evidence shows](https://www.example.com) that successful exporting countries:

* focus on a limited range of products and services
* sell to a limited number of countries

This is why [A Trading Nation](https://www.example.com) focusses on [key sectors](https://www.example.com) and [countries](https://www.example.com).


## Top 500 businesses
Scotland will also focus its resources around its top 500 exporting businesses.

Scotland currently has around 11,000 businesses who export. However, the top 500 are responsible for 80% of exports.

Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses could add 8% to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while increasing exports in the other 10,500 businesses would only add 2%.

Increasing exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses who supply them.


## Help for new exporters
All businesses in Scotland will still be able to get some [help to grow their business and start exporting](https://www.example.com). This includes businesses who are new to exporting.

We’re looking at ways we can deliver this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support available online.



## Changes to strategy
As well as focussing resources, other strategy changes will look to:

* increase and better focus help and support for the top [20 countries we export to](https://www.example.com)
* have a ‘today and tomorrow strategy’ that watches emerging markets and increases activities as opportunities occur
* use the Department for International Trade support where Scottish Development International have no representatives
* grow and make better use of the [GlobalScot](https://www.example.com) and Trade Envoys network in key markets
* support the top 500 exporters, helping them find new sectors, people and businesses to sell to
* use sales and exporting qualifications to upskill businesses

## Scottish enterprise agencies
[Scottish Enterprise](https://www.example.com) will now deliver a national trade and investment service for:

* Highlands and Islands Enterprise
* South of Scotland Enterprise

This will also be in partnership with private sector support organisations. For example, Chambers of Commerce.

This will be for businesses based in Scotland.

## Changes to policy
[A Trading Nation](https://www.example.com) has used a framework to organise its policy changes. This is known as an ‘ACE model’. This stands for:

* awareness and ambition
* capacity and capabilities
* expand and exploit

This means [A Trading Nation](https://www.example.com) aims to:

* raise awareness of exporting and encourage businesses to see it as an ambition
* build the capacity and capabilities of exporting businesses
* help businesses expand so they can take up opportunities to export


## Raising awareness and encouraging ambition
To raise awareness of exporting and encourage businesses to do it, [A Trading Nation](https://www.example.com) will put in place:

* a business-to-business mentorship programme (through the First Minister’s Export Challenge)
* £xm for a campaign to encourage business leaders to export  
* £xm to develop a Scotland Is Now marketing campaign around Scottish business excellence
* support Team Scotland to showcase at the Dubai Expo 2020  


## Building capacity and capabilities in exporting businesses
To help build capacity and capabilities in exporting businesses, we’ll:

* work with Chambers of Commerce to organise trade missions
* give £xm to run courses to make sure at least YYY companies every year can use global ecommerce platforms such as Amazon, Ali Baba
* update the data used in [A Trading Nation](https://www.example.com) every year and make it available online in a user-friendly way
* focus resources around differing levels of business needs
* focus resources around key [countries](https://www.example.com) and [sectors](https://www.example.com)  
* £xm to fund exporting qualifications for business development managers


We’ll also support our top exporters through:

* Scottish Enterprise
* stakeholders offering tailored export support
* economic diplomacy interventions


## Helping businesses expand and exploit opportunities
To help businesses expand and take advantage of opportunities we'll:

* create of Z Trade Envoy positions and relaunch the Global Scot programme in key markets
* establish Trade & Investment ministerial visits to key markets
* use overseas networks to offer support tailored to market conditions and business needs
* refocus government resources to better support demand for Scotland’s products and services
* provide better coordination and collaboration with the Department for International Trade on trade missions


Scottish Development International will also improve their market intelligence and export support. They'll realign their overseas network to match the opportunities in [A Trading Nation](https://www.example.com).

Scottish Government will spend £xm to help with this and create Y new in-market specialist roles.
