In 2017, energy made up:

* 11.7% of Scotland’s international exports (£3.8 billion)
* 15.9% of Scotland’s UK exports (£7.8 billion)

The energy sector covers:

* mining and mining support
* utilities, such as electricity, gas, renewables

[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) covers some oil and gas sector activities, such as:

* consultancy
* engineering
* equipment

It does not include oil and gas production.

## How Scotland’s energy exports have increased since 2002
![Graph showing how Scotland’s energy exports increased to the rest of the UK and internationally between 2002 and 2017.](/assets/images/charts_and_graphs/sector/energy-figure-1.jpg)


Between 2002 and 2017 Scotland’s energy exports increased:
* internationally from £700 million to £3.8 billion
* to the rest of the UK from £2.6 billion to £7.8 billion

## Where we can sell more
[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) used evidence to work out [where Scotland could sell the most in future](/where-we-could-sell-more/).

This evidence shows where:

* there’s a large or growing demand for imports
* Scotland’s exporting less than other, similar countries

## What we're going to do

### Access to data

We'll help industry bodies get better access to data on energy, so they can identify export opportunities.

### In-market specialists
We'll work with Scottish Development International and Opportunity North East to invest in five overseas in-market specialists.

These specialists will find new business opportunities for the Scottish energy supply chain. They'll do this by building relationships with:

* customers
* government departments
* regulators
* intermediaries

### Nuclear decommissioning
We'll develop a Scottish nuclear decommissioning capability statement, international mapping and networking exercise.

### Global low carbon transition
We'll work with Scottish businesses to take up opportunities created by the global change to low carbon technologies. We’ll do this by:

* supporting the oil and gas supply chain to diversify
* helping businesses increase their sales to new countries and sectors
