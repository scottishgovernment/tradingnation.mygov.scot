## What we're going to do

As part of the [Scotland Food and Drink Export Plan](https://foodanddrink.scot/resources/publications/export-strategy/), the public sector and industry co-fund market specialists in 15 countries.

This helps to support:

* Scotland Food and Drink’s approach to exporting premium products in retail and food service
* mentoring and matching companies through the [Export Collaboration Charter](https://foodanddrink.scot/resources/publications/export-collaboration-charter/) and the First Minister’s Export Challenge
* industry in making trade agreements
