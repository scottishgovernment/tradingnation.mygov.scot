This evidence shows where:

* there’s a large or growing demand for imports

## sWhat we can sell more of

[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) highlights key opportunities for Scottish businesses to sell more. This includes:

* middle class consumer markets in developed and developing countries, where Scottish brands are appealing to people and businesses
* white spirits, which sell the most in the global spirits market, presenting opportunities for Scottish gin producers. This also leaves scope for growth and diversity in whisky
* consolidating and expanding on the food sector for international markets through targeted retail and food service
* potential export opportunities of around £1 billion (mainly in fish and seafood) already identified in Scotland Food and Drink’s export plan
