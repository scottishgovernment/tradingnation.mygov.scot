## Where we can sell more

[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) used evidence to work out [where Scotland could sell the most in future](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/where-we-could-sell-more/).

This evidence shows where:

* there’s a large or growing demand for imports
* Scotland’s exporting less than other, similar countries

> The similar countries are Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland.

## What we're going to do

To help life and chemical sciences exports, we'll:

* work with industry bodies and the enterprise agencies to create market development plans for selected sub-sectors and countries
* use Ministerial visits to build relationships with parent companies of key Scottish-based businesses
* develop the international leadership and sales skills of businesses, helping them take advantage of export opportunities
* find [GlobalScots](https://www.globalscot.com/) or Trade Envoys who can offer businesses advice, support and introductions
