## What we're going to do

To help life and chemical sciences exports, we'll:

* work with industry bodies and the enterprise agencies to create market development plans for selected sub-sectors and countries
* use Ministerial visits to build relationships with parent companies of key Scottish-based businesses
* develop the international leadership and sales skills of businesses, helping them take advantage of export opportunities
* find [GlobalScots](https://www.globalscot.com/) or Trade Envoys who can offer businesses advice, support and introductions
