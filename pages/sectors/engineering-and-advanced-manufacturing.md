In 2017, engineering and advanced manufacturing made up:

* 17.6% of Scotland’s international exports (£5.7 billion)
* 9.7% of Scotland’s UK exports (£4.7 billion)

Engineering and advanced manufacturing covers things like:

* metal manufacturing
* machinery and equipment
* transport equipment
* architectural activities
* engineering services for example: design, consultancy


## How Scotland’s engineering and advanced manufacturing exports have increased since 2002
![Graph showing Scotland’s engineering and advanced manufacturing exports. It shows that both international exports and exports the rest of the UK increased between 2002 and 2017.](/assets/images/charts_and_graphs/sector/Engineering and Advanced manufacturing - Figure 1.jpg)

Between 2002 and 2017 Scotland’s engineering and advanced manufacturing exports increased:

* internationally from £3.6 billion to £5.7 billion
* to the rest of the UK from £3.8 billion to £4.7 billion


## Where we can sell more
[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) used evidence to work out [where Scotland could sell the most in future](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/where-we-could-sell-more/).

This evidence shows where:

* there’s a large or growing demand for imports
* Scotland’s exporting less than other, similar countries

> The similar countries are Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland.

## What we're going to do
To help engineering and advanced manufacturing exports, we’ll:

* work with industry bodies and the enterprise agencies to create market development plans for selected sub-sectors and countries
* support businesses to develop international leadership and sales skills
* work with industry bodies to share new ideas and exporting best practice
* help the industry to get high quality graduates and technical talent
* make sure businesses can still get skilled overseas employees (post-EU exit)
* help businesses to get finance for export growth plans
* find [GlobalScots](https://www.globalscot.com/) or Trade Envoys who can offer businesses advice, support or introductions
* help businesses find export opportunities by exploring ways to make sector data available
