## How Scotland’s technology, digital and media exports have changed since 2002

![Graph showing how Scotland’s technology, digital and media exports to the rest of the UK and internationally changed between 2002 and 2017.](/assets/images/charts_and_graphs/sector/Technology - Figure 1.jpg)

Between 2002 and 2017 Scotland’s technology, digital and media exports:

* decreased internationally from £5.9 billion to £3.3 billion
* increased to the rest of the UK from £2.3 billion to £3.1 billion

> International exports in this sector decreased between 2002 and 2007. This was due to a decline in Scotland’s electronics manufacturing industry.


## Where we can sell more

[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) used evidence to work out [where Scotland could sell the most in future](/where-we-could-sell-more/).

This evidence shows where:

* there’s a large or growing demand for imports
* Scotland’s exporting less than other, similar countries

> The similar countries are Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland.

## What we're going to do

To help technology, digital and media exports, we’ll:

* work with industry bodies and the enterprise agencies to create market development plans for selected sub-sectors and countries
* improve access to high quality graduates and technical talent
* make sure businesses can still get skilled overseas employees (post-EU exit)
* help businesses to get finance for export growth plans
* find [GlobalScots](https://www.globalscot.com/) or Trade Envoys who can help businesses with advice, support or introductions
