## Where we can sell more

[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) used evidence to work out [where Scotland could sell the most in future](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/where-things-are-being-bought/).

This evidence shows where:

* there’s a large or growing demand for imports
* Scotland’s exporting less than other, similar countries

> The similar countries are Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland.

As a business organisation, lobby group or trade body I need:

- information, evidence, data and intelligence                                                   

As internal staff (SG, SE, HIE, SOS, the Minister) we need:

- have clear evidence for decisions
