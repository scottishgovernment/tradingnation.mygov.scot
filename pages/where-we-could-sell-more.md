[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) focusses on exporting to 26 countries. Evidence shows these countries are where Scotland's exports are most likely to grow.

## Countries we’ll look to export to

A Trading Nation organises countries into 3 priority groups.

### Priority group 1
The 15 countries in the first priority group are:

* [United States of America](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/usa/)
* [Germany](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/germany/)
* [France](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/france/)
* [Netherlands](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/netherlands/)
* [Switzerland](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/switzerland/)
* [Norway](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/norway/)
* [Poland](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/poland/)
* [Belgium](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/belgium/)
* [China](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/china/)

These countries currently make up 66% of Scotland’s exports. They’re expected to provide the most opportunity for Scotland’s future export growth.

To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in place support including:

* Scottish Development International help in each country

* Turkey
* Mexico
* India
* Singapore
* the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
* Nigeria
* South Korea

These countries currently make up 14% of Scotland’s exports. These countries are expected to provide opportunities for businesses in:

* the mid to long term
* specific sectors

To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in place support including:

* help from Scottish Development International
* trade envoys for specific sectors
* help from the GlobalScot network

We’ll also look to make use of the Department for International Trade’s support where possible.

To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in place support including help from:

* Department for International Trade

## How countries were chosen

Each country was chosen based on evidence. This evidence drew on a range of sources that looked at:

* how much Scotland currently exports there
* how we think exports there could increase in future
* how much other countries are exporting there
* things about that country that can benefit key sectors
