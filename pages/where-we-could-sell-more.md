[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) focusses on exporting to 26 countries. Evidence shows these countries are where Scotland's exports are most likely to grow.

## Countries we’ll look to export to

A Trading Nation organises countries into 3 priority groups.

### Priority group 1
The 15 countries in the first priority group are:

* [United States of America](/country-profiles/usa/)
* [Germany](/country-profiles/germany/)
* [France](/country-profiles/france/)
* [Netherlands](/country-profiles/netherlands/)
* [Switzerland](/country-profiles/switzerland/)
* [Norway](/country-profiles/norway/)
* [Poland](/country-profiles/poland/)
* [Belgium](/country-profiles/belgium/)
* [China](/country-profiles/china/)
* [Ireland](/country-profiles/ireland/)
* [Denmark](/country-profiles/denmark/)
* [Sweden](/country-profiles/sweden/)
* [Italy](/country-profiles/italy/)
* [Canada](/country-profiles/canada/)
* [Spain](/country-profiles/spain/)


These countries currently make up 66% of Scotland’s exports. They’re expected to provide the most opportunity for Scotland’s future export growth.

To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in place support including:

* Scottish Development International help in each country
* trade envoys for specific sectors
* help from the GlobalScot network
* help from in-market sector specialists
* trade missions and Ministerial visits


### Priority group 2
The 11 countries in the second priority group are:

* Japan
* Australia
* Turkey
* Mexico
* India
* Singapore
* United Arab Emirates (UAE)
* Nigeria
* South Korea
* Brazil
* Indonesia

These countries currently make up 14% of Scotland’s exports. These countries are expected to provide opportunities for businesses in:

* the mid to long term
* specific sectors

To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in place support including:

* help from Scottish Development International
* trade envoys for specific sectors
* help from the GlobalScot network

We’ll also look to make use of the Department for International Trade’s support where possible.

### Priority group 3

The third priority group are countries that might offer opportunities for certain Scottish businesses.

To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in place support including help from:

* Department for International Trade
* the GlobalScot network

## How countries were chosen

Each country was chosen based on evidence. This evidence drew on a range of sources that looked at:

* how much Scotland currently exports there
* how we think exports there could increase in future
* how much other countries are exporting there
* things about that country that can benefit key sectors
