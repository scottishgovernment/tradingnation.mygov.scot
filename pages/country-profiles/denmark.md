##The benefits of selling to Denmark
The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates Denmark as the 3rd easiest country in the world to do business with.

Denmark’s a good place to export to because it has a:

* strong economy
* highly educated workforce

It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* people and businesses look to buy similar things as in the UK
* it has a high standard of living, so people have money to spend
* UK brands are trusted there
