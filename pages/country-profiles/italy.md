## The benefits of selling to Italy

The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates Italy as the 51st easiest country in the world to do business with.

Italy’s a good place to export to because it:

* has a good manufacturing sector

* gives opportunities to export to the Mediterranean and the Middle East

It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* it has similar regulations to the UK
* UK brands are trusted there
