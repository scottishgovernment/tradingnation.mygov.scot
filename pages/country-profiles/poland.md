## The benefits of selling to Poland
The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates Poland as the 33rd easiest country in the world to do business with.

Poland’s a good place to export to because it:

* sits in the centre of Europe
* has a lot of people and businesses to sell to
* has a highly educated work force

It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* it could create opportunities to export to other places in central and eastern Europe
* English is widely spoken
* it has a strong and growing economy
