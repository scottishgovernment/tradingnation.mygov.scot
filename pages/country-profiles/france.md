## The benefits of selling to France
The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates France as the 32nd easiest country in the world to do business with.

France’s a good place to export to because it:

* has well defined and established laws
* does not have a lot of regulations which can cause barriers for trade

It's also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* it has a high standard of living and people have money to spend
* it’s close to Scotland
* they make, buy and sell lots of different things

## What we could sell more of
[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) uses evidence to work out [what Scotland could sell more of](/what-we-could-sell-more-of/).

In France, the key sectors where Scotland could sell more are:

* chemical sciences
* metal manufacturing
* transport equipment
* textiles
