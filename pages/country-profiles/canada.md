## The benefits of selling to Canada
The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates Canada as the 22nd easiest country in the world to do business with.

Canada’s a good place to export to because it has a:

* strong economy
* highly educated workforce

It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* English is the first language
* it has similar laws and regulations as the UK
* it has a high standard of living, so people have money to spend

* [food](/sectors/food-and-drink/)
