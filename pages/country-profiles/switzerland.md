## The benefits of selling to Switzerland
The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates Switzerland as the 38th easiest country in the world to do business with.

Switzerland’s a good place to export to because it:

* has a highly skilled work force
* has an excellent public infrastructure
* values new ideas for products and services
* spends a lot on research and development
* has reliable laws and regulations
* sits in the centre of Europe

It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* English is widely spoken
* it has similar laws and regulations
* it has a high standard of living, so people have money to spend
* it has lots of people from different cultures, looking to buy different things
