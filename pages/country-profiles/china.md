## The benefits of selling to China
The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates China as the 46th easiest country in the world to do business with.

China’s a good place to export to because it has:

* a huge, growing number of people and businesses
* a stable economy

It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* UK brands have a positive reputation there
* it will be the world’s biggest buyer of luxury goods in 2020
* it has the largest population in the world
* an increasing number of people and businesses are buying more
