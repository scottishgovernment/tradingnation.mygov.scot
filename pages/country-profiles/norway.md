## The benefits of selling to Norway
The [World Bank](http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) rates Norway as the 7th easiest country in the world to do business with.

Norway’s a good place to export to because it has:

* a lot of natural resources
* a good business culture
* very little corruption

It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:

* UK brands are trusted there
* English is widely spoken in business there
* it has a high standard of living, so people have money to spend
* its economy is stable
