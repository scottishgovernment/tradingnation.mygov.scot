<p class='leader'>In 2017, Scotland exported over <b>£32 billion</b> of products and services.</p>

Exporting helps Scotland’s economy to grow and creates jobs. It also helps the Scottish Government collect more tax to:
* improve living standards
* improve public services

Exporting also helps Scotland build good relationships with other countries. This can help Scotland to have a positive influence on the world.

## How exporting helps businesses

Exporting helps businesses to grow. How much businesses grow depends on:

* the number of people and businesses they can sell to
* their competitors and what they do
* the products and services they offer

## Selling to more people and businesses

Exporting means that businesses can sell to more people and businesses. For example, businesses that only sell to Scotland can sell to:

* 4.5 million adults
* 345,000 businesses

But businesses that sell to other countries can sell to a larger number of people and businesses.

For example in the United States of America, businesses can sell to:

* 252 million adults
* 28 million businesses


## Competitors, products and services

Exporting can mean that businesses have more competitors.

But this can be a positive thing and can lead them to develop new products and services.

## Improving productivity

Exporting helps businesses to become more productive. This means they produce more with the same amount of resources.

Scotland’s working age population is getting smaller. This means Scotland needs businesses to be more productive. Productivity helps to:

* increase people’s income
* improve living standards

Businesses that export tend to be more productive. This is because they spend more money on:

* creating new products or services
* improving the skills of their workers


## Making businesses stronger

Exporting also means businesses do not have to rely on a single market. This helps businesses to spread any risks.

For example, if sales drop in one market, the risk to their business will be less if they have other markets they sell to.

## Scotland’s export growth plan

Because exporting is important to Scotland and its businesses, the Scottish Government has created an export growth plan. This plan is called A Trading Nation.
