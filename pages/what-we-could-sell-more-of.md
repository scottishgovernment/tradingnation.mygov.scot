[A Trading Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/) focuses on the following sectors:

*	[financial and business services](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/sectors/financial-and-business/)
*	[food and drink](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/sectors/food-and-drink/)  
*	[life and chemical sciences](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/sectors/science/)  
*	[engineering](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/sectors/engineering/)  
*	[energy](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/sectors/energy/)  
*	[technology, digital and media](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/sectors/technology/)

Evidence shows these sectors are where Scotland's exports have the most opportunity to grow.

## How sectors were chosen
Each sector was chosen based on evidence. This evidence drew on a range of quantitative and qualitative sources, that looked at:

* what Scotland is currently selling abroad
* the number of people and businesses there are to sell to
* where people or businesses are importing more
* the things people and business want or need, across the world
* where Scotland is well placed to supply things compared to our competitors

## Comparing countries
[Different countries were compared](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/country-profiles/) to work out which countries offered opportunities to grow:

* across sectors
* for specific sectors only

This showed that the [top 4 countries](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/where-we-could-sell-more/) had opportunities in all chosen sectors. While, the [rest of the countries](https://tradingnation.mygov.scot/where-we-could-sell-more/) had opportunities in only some of the chosen sectors.
